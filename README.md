# route_generator
Based on a Graph Database of touristic places with detailed information, this tool should be able to generate the best routes that fit the users' preferences from simple needs such as date range, weather, beach available, etc.. to more complex demands like 'booze allowed +18', population speaks english, 'has not been in war in the last 10 years', etc.. this complex filtering is possible due to the power of Knowledge Graphs. More and more information can be added to the Graph Database and all the processes to calculate the routes will not change with it.
